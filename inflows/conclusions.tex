\section{Overview}

In vela2b, halo number 27, there is a structure with abnormally low
metallicity.  It is a column-like structure that extends from the edge of the 
box to the galaxy itself. The gas is generally infalling and cold, with  
characteristic temperatures around $10^4$ K and ddensities ranging from 
$10^{-2}\,-\,10^{-6}$.


To explore the structure, we explored the time evolution of several parameters
consisting of various spatial and kinematic structures, as well as metallicity.
We also looked at larger temperature ranges. These are broken up into ``cool''
gas ($3.5\,<\,\log(T)\,<\,4.5$), ``warm'' gas ($3.5\,<\,\log(T)\,<\,4.5$), and
``hot'' gas ($3.5\,<\,\log(T)\,<\,4.5$). A very import conlclusion is that
within a given temperature range, the density range selected corresponds to a
galectocentric distance, with lower densities corresponding to a larger
distance. For a given density range, as the temperature increases the
corresponding distance decreases. For our cool gas, at $z\,=\,0$, the density
ranges we chose correspond to distances ranging from 0.5 R$_{vir}$ to 4.0
R$_{vir}$, while hot gas in the same redshifts only range from 0.5 R$_{vir}$
to 1.5 R$_{vir}$, implying that hot gas is mostly contrained to the CGM. 



\section{Spatial}
Over time the filament's spatial distribution changes, but always occupies the same 
region of space. At high redhsift the filament is not well constructed. At $z\,=\,4$
the filament consists of several small ($\sim$ 10 kpc) clouds that do not form a
coherent structure. The clouds quickly come together as time passes. As tiem
passes, the filament becomes more coherent and structured. It eventualy extends
completely from the galaxy to the edge of the box.
